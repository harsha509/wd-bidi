// Models and modules in your application are linked through functionality and data handling.
//
//     A module in your application corresponds to a specific functionality or feature. It encapsulates related logic, data processing, and operations into a self-contained unit. Each module, depending on its functionality, interacts with or manipulates certain kinds of data.
// //
//     For example, a "Session" module might handle operations related to user sessions like logging in, maintaining the session, and logging out.
//
//     A model, on the other hand, directly corresponds to the kind of data being handled. The model outlines the structure of this data and possibly methods for validating and manipulating it.
//
//     In the above example of a "Session" module, there would be a corresponding "Session" model which defines what a session is in terms of data. It might include fields like sessionId, userId, loginTime, logoutTime, etc.
//
//     How are they linked?
//
//     The "Session" module would use the "Session" model whenever it needs to create a new session, validate session data, or manipulate session data. Here's a very high-level example involving a user login operation:
//
// typescript
//
//
// // Inside your Session module
// import { SessionModel } from '../models/session';
//
// class Session {
//     create(userId: string) {
//         const session = new SessionModel(userId);
//         // The line above uses the SessionModel structure to create a new session
//         // Then you might save this session to a database, send it to a client, etc.
//     }
// }
// In this way, the module and model are connected.
// The module uses the model as a blueprint for dealing with session data.
// This use of models helps to ensure data consistency and structure throughout your application.
